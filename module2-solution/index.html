    <p class="name one">Confidentiality</p>
    <p class="content">Confidentiality involves protecting sensitive data private and safe from unauthorized access. This includes protecting information from bad actors with malicious intent, as well as limiting access to only authorized individuals within an organization. Examples of confidentiality of electronic data being compromised include laptop theft, password theft, or sensitive emails being sent to the incorrect individuals.</p>

    <p class="name two">Integrity</p>
    <p class="content">Maintaining data integrity is important to make sure data and business analysts are accessing accurate information. Data shown to the public must also maintain integrity so that customers can trust the organization. Information security systems typically incorporate controls to ensure their own integrity, in particular protecting the kernel or core functions against both deliberate and accidental threats.</p>

    <p class="name three">Availability</p>
    <p class="content">Availability refers to the idea that the people who need access to data can get itâ€”without affecting its confidentiality or integrity.You want the recipients of that email you sent to be able to access it, display it, and even save it for future use. Ensuring availability also involves preventing denial-of-service attacks, such as a flood of incoming messages to the target system, essentially forcing it to shut down.</p>
